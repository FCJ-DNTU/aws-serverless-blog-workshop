# Workshop: Deploy Serverless Blog Website on AWS With Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3 & CloudFront

### Overview

In this workshop, you will learn how to build and deploy an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** on AWS.  
We will use **AWS Lambda** for preprocessing and inference, **API Gateway** to expose RESTful endpoints, **S3** for data storage, **Amazon SageMaker** for model training and hosting, **DynamoDB** for metadata storage, and **CloudWatch** for monitoring and logging.
