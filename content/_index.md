# Workshop: Building an End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline on AWS with Lambda, API Gateway, S3, SageMaker & DynamoDB

### Overview

In this workshop, you will learn how to build and deploy an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** on AWS.  
We will use **AWS Lambda** for preprocessing and inference, **API Gateway** to expose RESTful endpoints, **S3** for data storage, **Amazon SageMaker** for model training and hosting, **DynamoDB** for metadata storage, and **CloudWatch** for monitoring and logging.

### Objectives:

- Understand how to design and deploy a complete ML pipeline on AWS.  
- Build and configure data ingestion, preprocessing, and model training workflows.  
- Deploy and manage machine learning models with Amazon SageMaker.  
- Expose inference endpoints through API Gateway and Lambda.  
- Integrate DynamoDB for model metadata and monitoring with CloudWatch.  
- Learn best practices for IAM permissions and cost optimization.

### Requirements:

- AWS account with IAM access (Free Tier: https://aws.amazon.com/free)  
- Basic knowledge of Python or Go (for Lambda functions and ML scripts)  
- Familiarity with REST APIs and JSON  
- Tools: AWS CLI, Git, Docker (optional), and a web browser  
- (Optional) Postman for testing inference endpoints
